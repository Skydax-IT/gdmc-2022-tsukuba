# GDMC - 2022 - Tsukuba
Repository for the Procedural Content Generation in Minecraft Internship Research Project at the University of Tsukuba, 2022.

## Project description 
This project was developed as part of the Generative Design in Minecraft Competition (GDMC). This annual competition challenges developers from all over the world to write an algorithm that can create a settlement for a given, unknown Minecraft map.

This project is focused on the development of a Procedural Content Generation System, that uses artificial techniques such as genetic algorithms, combinatorial search heuristics and artificial life in order to build a settlement in Minecraft. 

## How to run this project?
- Make sure to have the [http interface mod](https://github.com/nilsgawlik/gdmc_http_interface) installed
- Open a minecraft world, and run the `setbuildarea x0 y0 z0 x1 y1 z1` command
